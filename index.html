about how <br>
My life got flipped-turned upside down <br>
And I'd like to take a minute <br>
Just sit right there <br>
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air <br>
In west Philadelphia born and raised <br>
On the playground was where I spent most of my days <br>
Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool <br>
And all shootin some b-ball outside of the school <br>
When a couple of guys who were up to no good <br>
Started making trouble in my neighborhood <br>
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared <br>
She said 'You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air' <br>
I begged and pleaded with her day after day <br>
But she packed my suit case and sent me on my way <br>
She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket. <br>
I put my Walkman on and said, 'I might as well kick it'. <br>
First class, yo this is bad <br>
Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass. <br>
Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like? <br>
Hmm this might be alright. <br>
But wait I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that <br>
Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat? <br>
I don't think so <br>
I'll see when I get there <br>
I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air <br>
Well, the plane landed and when I came out <br>
There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out <br>
I ain't trying to get arrested yet <br>
I just got here <br>
I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared <br>
I whistled for a cab and when it came near <br>
The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror <br>
If anything I could say that this cab was rare <br>
But I thought 'Nah, forget it' - 'Yo, homes to Bel Air' <br>
I pulled up to the house about seven or eigth <br>
And I yelled to the cabbie 'Yo homes smell ya later' <br>
I looked at my kingdom <br>
I was finally there <br>
To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air <br>
